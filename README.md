# HNG Internship  

This repository was created exclusively for the **HNG Internship**, a program designed to accelerate learning and growth in the tech industry. It serves as a dedicated space for showcasing projects, completing tasks, and collaborating with fellow developers.  

Through this repository, I aim to refine my skills, contribute to real-world projects, and gain valuable hands-on experience. The journey of learning never stops, and this internship is an exciting step toward becoming a proficient front-end developer.
